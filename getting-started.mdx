## 🐳 How to get started with Docker on this Project locally (Optional)

1. Ensure Docker Desktop is installed and running.

2. Navigate to the repo root and run:

    ~~~
    cd docker
    docker build -t my-openapi-viewer .
    docker run --rm -p 8080:80 -v ../openapi.yaml:/usr/share/nginx/html/openapi.yaml my-openapi-viewer
    ~~~

3. Visit http://localhost:8080 to preview documentation via Redoc or Swagger UI.

4. All spec files are in the repo. No hidden dependencies or external fetches are needed to run this project locally in your systems irrespective of the OS.

## 💻 Previewing OpenAPI Sample Library in your Local systems

There are typically 3 ways to preview the project locally:

### 🔹Option-1 : Using Docker (Recommended)

After setting up Docker, you can run a containerized Redoc server:

```
docker run --rm -p 8080:80 \
  -v ${PWD}/openapi.yaml:/usr/share/nginx/html/openapi.yaml \
  redocly/redoc
```

🎉 Hurray!! You've set-up your local server, & it's ready for preview.

✅ Open your browser and visit: http://localhost:8080 for preview. 

🗒️This method ensures no local dependencies and is the widely accepted among developer communities for major projects.


### 🔹Option-2 : Using Swagger Editor (Browser-Based)

You can drag-and-drop/upload your `openapi.yaml` file into the online [Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/)

👉 You can validate & preview the spec interactively with syntax feedback.

🗒️ This methods requires you to go and check each .yaml file with APIs and view them manually each time.


### 🔹Option-3: Using Redocly CLI

    If you prefer working with a CLI and want to bundle your OpenAPI files:

    1. Install Redocly CLI:

    ```
    npm install -g @redocly/cli
    ```

    2. Run the bundler:

    ```
    redocly bundle openapi.yaml -o bundled.yaml
    ```

    3. Now, open `bundled.yaml` with Swagger or Redoc viewer.

## Validation Commands Used

```
npm install -g @redocly/cli    
```

```
redocly bundle "path/to/openapi.yaml" -o bundled.yaml
```

```
redocly bundle openapi.yaml -o bundled.yaml
```

```
redocly lint openapi.yaml
```
