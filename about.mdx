## Project Goals 
Collecting commonly used API examples to showcase in this OpenAPI Sample Library project. Endpoint with typical API design patterns: CRUD operations, authentication, filtering, pagination, webhooks, etc. are preferred. 

This project focuses on demonstrating different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH), parameters, request bodies, and response schemas.

## Criteria for Endpoint Selection

- **Usefulness:** includes endpoints to target real-world workflows commonly used by developers (e.g., issue creation, managing user methods, sending messages).

- **Variety:** includes different HTTP methods to demonstrate versatility: some simple (GET user) & some complex (POST with request body + authentication).

- **Well-documented:** enough details in docs to describe request/response schemas accurately.
