## Project Goals 
Collecting commonly used API examples to showcase in this OpenAPI Sample Library project. Endpoint with typical API design patterns: CRUD operations, authentication, filtering, pagination, webhooks, etc. are preferred. 

This project focuses on demonstrating different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH), parameters, request bodies, and response schemas.

## Criteria for Endpoint Selection

- **Usefulness:** includes endpoints to target real-world workflows commonly used by developers (e.g., issue creation, managing user methods, sending messages).

- **Variety:** includes different HTTP methods to demonstrate versatility: some simple (GET user) & some complex (POST with request body + authentication).

- **Well-documented:** enough details in docs to describe request/response schemas accurately.

## Flow of the Project

Start at the API’s main documentation page.

Step-1: Research & read the API’s main documentation page for various DevTools lkike GitHub, Stripe, etc.

Step-2: Further researched to pick endpoint categories to work on.

Step-3: After selecting the endpoints, reviewing each endpoint’s method, URL, parameters, and sample requests-responses.

Step-4: Documented & Worked on the selected API spec based on project goals.
